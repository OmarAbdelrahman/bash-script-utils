# bash-script-utils

A handy collection of reusable Bash scripts and functions designed to streamline
and simplify automation tasksâ€”making my scripting experience much smoother.

## Motivation

As someone who often finds Bash and Linux commands challenging especially
when it comes to remembering command names, arguments, and shorthand
options like **-s for --silent**.

I created this repository to simplify my scripting workflow.
This collection of helper scripts has been invaluable in making command-line
automation easier and more efficient for me, and I hope it can do the same for
others who could use a straightforward toolkit for their **_Bash_** scripting needs.
